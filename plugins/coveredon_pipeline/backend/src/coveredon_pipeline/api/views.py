"""Pipeline triage, stats, and health views for Covered On Baserow plugin.

All views authenticate via JWT token obtained from the Baserow REST API
using the admin credentials defined in BASEROW_ADMIN_EMAIL / BASEROW_ADMIN_PASSWORD
environment variables (or the .env file at /home/black/baserow-dmz/.env).

Reads tables 885 (Leads) and 884 (Orgs) through the Baserow REST API at
http://localhost:8682/api/ — NOT via Django ORM directly, because the task
spec requires going through the API path.

Endpoints:
  GET  pipeline/ping/   — health check
  GET  pipeline/triage/ — pipeline triage buckets
  GET  pipeline/stats/  — aggregate counts
